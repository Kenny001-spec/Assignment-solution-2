/**
 * ASSIGNMENT
 * 1. Convert the code above (Function Constructor) to ES6 Class
 * 2. Create another instance of volvoSUV with speed of 130 at charge of 58%
 * 3. Write *brake* method in ES6 üëá
 *      a. Speed will reduce by 10
 *      b. Charge will increase by 1
 * 4. Chain these two methods together to see the battery charge percentages
 * 
 * HINT: Don't forget to return *this* from each method...üòè
 * 
 * You are FREE to create as many additional instances to the two above as you wish.

 * Goodluck üçÄ
